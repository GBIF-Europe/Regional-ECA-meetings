# GBIF Europe and Central Asia (ECA) meetings

The GBIF nodes in Europe and Central Asia have maintained a series of annual (in-person) meetings since 2008. And a series of online monthly meetings since March 2022. The [GBIF regional Nodes committee for Europe and Central Asia (ECA)](https://www.gbif.org/the-gbif-network/europe) includes all GBIF Node Managers in the region.

## Annual GBIF ECA meetings

ECA Nodes meet at least once yearly, either as a side-event at the bi-annual Global Nodes Meeting (back-to-back with the GBIF Governing Board meetings) or in independent ECA Nodes meetings. All Node Managers are expected to attend the ECA meetings. ECA meetings are normally also open for node staff and interested observers from non-member countries or international organizations in the region. The purpose of the ECA Nodes meetings is coordination between ECA Nodes and the development of the [strategic work plans](https://github.com/GBIF-Europe/RegionalWorkProgramme). Normally one of the ECA Nodes will act as host for the meeting. ECA nodes will typically cover their own costs to attend the meetings.
